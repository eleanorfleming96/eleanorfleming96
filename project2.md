# What is Optimization?

**Optimization** is the process of finding the best solution to a problem from a set of possible solutions. It involves choosing the values of certain variables (called **decision variables**) to either:

- **Maximize** something desirable (like profit, efficiency, or happiness), and/or  
- **Minimize** something undesirable (like cost, time, or waste)  

while satisfying certain **constraints** (rules or limits) imposed by the problem.

*If you need a refresher on optimization, jump to sections 2 & 3 sections.*

Letâ€™s apply optimization to a financial portfolio to build or adjust a mix of investments (like stocks or other securities) to meet specific goals and rules. Tools like **Aladdin** help investors set up this problem by defining an **objective function (goals)** and **constraints (rules)**. Then, the tool finds the **best mix of investments** that satisfies all these requirements.
