title: Airflip Website & Documentation Redesign
---

## Improved Product Messaging and Engagement
- **Refined Messaging:** Conducted competitive analysis and applied a messaging framework to articulate Airflip's key benefits. By working backwards from personas, I aligned messaging with user needs, highlighting the most impactful features to solve their pain points effectively.
- **Engaging Visuals:** Created step-by-step workflow videos and animations using Screen Studio to simplify complex features, making them more accessible and visually compelling.
- **Optimized Call-to-Actions:** Enhanced CTAs through revised text, strategic placement, and visual design improvements, driving higher user engagement and conversion rates.

## Comprehensive and Accessible Documentation
- **Robust Help Center:** Designed an intuitive documentation site using Mintlify at [help.airflip.com](https://www.help.airflip.com). It includes detailed product guides, terminology definitions, and user-centric content tailored to resolve common pain points.
- **Seamless Integration:** Linked documentation directly to platform features, allowing users to access relevant guidance in real-time without leaving the product.

## Measurable Impact
- **+15% Website Engagement:** Increased engagement through refined messaging and visuals.
- **Boosted Demo Requests:** Strengthened Airflipâ€™s market positioning, reflected in higher demo requests from the landing page.
- **Reduced Inquiries:** Comprehensive documentation significantly decreased inbound customer support questions.
